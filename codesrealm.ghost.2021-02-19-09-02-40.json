to leave out the intricacies of the SOLID principle and write about it succinctly in detail, but yet simple codes samples. Let’s get started\\n\\nThe SOLID principle is a design pattern that enables and disciplines us to write reusable, decoupled, and maintainable code. That is as simple as it can get.\\n\\nNow, we know what the  SOLID principles want to get out of us, let’s briefly talk about what makes a code SOLID.  SOLID codes have to satisfy SOLID principle checklist which leads us to the SOLID acronym and what it means.\\n\\n* S: Single Responsible Principle (SRP)\\n* O: Open Closed Principle (OSP)\\n* L: Liskov Substituion Principle\\n* I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\\n* D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\\n\\n   \\n\\nLet’s go throw each with code walkthrough\\n\\n## S: Single Responsible Principle (SRP)\\n> *<p class=\\\"strong-point-highlight\\\">A class should have only one reason to change</p>*\\n\\nSRP says that a class should focus on one specific thing rather than do multiple things.  The SRP simple does not mean a class should have only one method, but everything the class does should revolve around one thing.\\nFor example, a <b>Person</b> class might have the responsibility of carrying out a various operation such as creating a new person’s record, update, delete,  and retrieve from a data store. The class can also be tasked on how to present information to a user such as print, display, sending email, logging etc. \\n\\nMixing up responsibility makes a class unmaintainable, challenging to understand and makes writing unit tests a nightmare because the responsibilities cannot be separated and thus ultimately violates SRP.  \\n\\n<p class=\\\"space\\\"></p>\\n\\nLet’s see an example of SRP violation:  \\n\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-cs\\\">\\n    public class Person\\n    {\\n        public Guid PersonId { get; set; }\\n        public string FirstName { get; set; }\\n        public string LastName { get; set; }\\n        private decimal Salary { get; set; }\\n\\n        private string Mydocpath = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.MyDocuments);\\n\\n        public string FullName()\\n        {\\n            return $\\\"{FirstName} - {LastName}\\\";\\n        }\\n\\n        public decimal GetSalary()\\n        {\\n            return this.Salary;\\n        }\\n\\n        public void IncreaseSalary(decimal percentage)\\n        {\\n            this.Salary += this.Salary * percentage;\\n        }\\n\\n        public void SavePerson()\\n        {\\n            try\\n            {\\n                // code for saving person to a data store\\n\\n                //After a person has been saved, we send confirmation email\\n                var mailMessage = new MailMessage(\\\"MailFrom\\\", \\\"MailTo\\\", \\\"Subject\\\", \\\"Body\\\");\\n                this.SendEmail(mailMessage);\\n\\n            }\\n            catch (Exception e)\\n            {\\n                System.IO.File.WriteAllText(this.Mydocpath + @\\\"\\\\Exceptionsfile.txt\\\", e.ToString());\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        public void SendEmail(MailMessage mail)\\n        {\\n            try\\n            {\\n                // Code for getting Email setting and send mail\\n            }\\n            catch (Exception e)\\n            {\\n                System.IO.File.WriteAllText(this.Mydocpath + @\\\"\\\\Exceptionsfile.txt\\\", e.ToString());\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n    }\\n</code></pre>\\n   \\n   \\n   \\n  The *Person* class violates SRP, as it behaves like a God Object. A *God Object* is a class which does everything.

This scenario will work well without issues only if we have to calculate only three shapes, Triangle, Rectangle Circle. What if we need to calculate the area of a sphere tomorrow or a rhombus? We will have to alter the ==*Shape*== class and add one or more if condition to satisfy the requirement and equally alter the enum to add the new type of shape. Adding more if conditions to cater to new shapes will quickly run out of hands and make the code unmaintainable and difficult to test. Hence, the class is not ==\\\"closed for modification\\\"==.    \\n\\n<p class=\\\"space\\\"></p>\\n\\nLet's make the ==*Shape*== class \\\"Open for extension, but closed for modification\\\" hence satisfying OSP.  \\n\\n\\n#### OSP solution:  \\n\\n<pre><code>\\n    public abstract class Shape\\n    {\\n        public abstract double CalculateArea();\\n    }\\n\\n\\n    public class Triangle : Shape\\n    {\\n        public double Base { get; set; }\\n        public double Height { get; set; }\\n\\n        public override double CalculateArea()\\n        {\\n            return 0.5 * Base * Height;\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n\\n    public class Cirle : Shape\\n    {\\n        public double Radius { get; set; }\\n        public override double CalculateArea()\\n        {\\n            return Math.PI * (Radius * Radius);\\n        }\\n    }\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n\\nNow that looks much better. The ==*Shape*== class is now closed for modification because to add a new feature of calculating a new shape, we don't alter or modify the Shape class. Instead, we extended it by using inheritance.  \\n\\nExtending the Shape class further by adding the rhombus shape will look like this:  \\n\\n\\n<pre><code>\\n    public class Rhombus : Shape\\n    {\\n        public double Diagonal { get; set; }\\n        public override double CalculateArea()\\n        {\\n            return (1/2) * Diagonal * Diagonal;\\n        }\\n    }\\n</code></pre>\\n\\nViola! we have satisfied OSP.  \\n\\n<p class=\\\"space\\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\\"space\\\"></p>\\n\\n## L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)\\n> *<p class=\\\"strong-point-highlight\\\">Objects in a program should be replacable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of the that program.</p>*  \\n\\n\\nIn a simple translation, a child class can replace a parent class in a code, and it should not break that code. e.g. If class Dog is a child(derived class) of class Animal(base class), then instances of Dog can replace the instance of Animal without issue. Liskov substitution principle goes a bit deeper, but for a simple explanation is a good starting position.  \\n\\n__Note:__ ==*LSP is about honoring contracts and not intending to change the behaviour of a base class.*==  \\n\\n\\nThe code below violates LSP in that derived class Square changed the behaviour of the base class.\\n\\nViolation of LSP: \\n\\n<pre><code>\\n    public class Rectangle\\n    {\\n        public virtual Int32 Height { get; set; }\\n        public virtual Int32 Width { get; set; }\\n\\n        public virtual void CalculateArea()\\n        {\\n            Console.WriteLine($\\\"The area is: {Height * Width}\\\");\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    public class Square : Rectangle\\n    {\\n        public override Int32 Height\\n        {\\n            get => base.Height;\\n            set => SetDimensions(value);\\n        }\\n\\n        public override Int32 Width\\n        {\\n            get => base.Width;\\n            set => SetDimensions(value);\\n        }\\n\\n        private void SetDimensions(Int32 value)\\n        {\\n            base.Height = value;\\n            base.Width = value;\\n        }\\n    }\\n</code></pre>  \\n\\nGiving the above code, a quick run, the output says The area is 9, which is correct as the area of a square is (width)<sup>2</sup>. <span class=\\\"text-danger\\\">But!</span> this violates the LSP that states that a derived class should replace a base class without breaking or altering the program.\\n\\n<pre><code>\\n    static void Main(string[] args)\\n    {\\n        Rectangle rectangle = new Square();\\n        rectangle.Height = 2;\\n        rectangle.Width = 3;\\n\\n        rectangle.CalculateArea(); // The area is 9\\n        Console.ReadKey();\\n    }\\n</code></pre>  \\n\\nLet implement the code to become LSP compliant. The solution to this problem is not straightforward, but let have a look. Remember the OCP, if a code is OCP complaint, that code is more likely to be LSP compliant as well. ==*As a rule of thumb, try to move implementation that may differ to the derived classes and leave the more general implementation to the base class.*==\\n\\n<pre><code>\\n    public interface IShape\\n    {\\n        void CalculateArea();\\n    }\\n\\n    public class Square : IShape\\n    {\\n        public double Width { get; set; }\\n        public void CalculateArea()\\n        {\\n            Console.WriteLine($\\\"The area is {Math.Pow(Width, 2)}\\\");\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    public class Rhombus : IShape\\n    {\\n        public double Diagonal { get; set; }\\n        public void CalculateArea()\\n        {\\n            Console.WriteLine($\\\"The area is: {(1 / 2) * Diagonal * Diagonal}\\\");\\n        }\\n    }\\n</code></pre>    \\n\\nThe base class IShape contract is now implemented by Square and Rhombus with no violation by not allowing the subclasses to change the behaviour of the base class. \\n\\n__Important:__ If a code is OSP complaint, it is likely, it is  LSP complaint as both go hand in hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\\\"space\\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\\"space\\\"></p>\\n\\n## I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\\n> *<p class=\\\"strong-point-highlight\\\">No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not need.

The class can also be tasked on how to present information to a user such as print, display, sending email, logging etc.</p>\n<p>Mixing up responsibility makes a class unmaintainable, challenging to understand and makes writing unit tests a nightmare because the responsibilities cannot be separated and thus ultimately violates SRP.</p>\n<p class=\"space\"></p>\n<p>Let’s see an example of SRP violation:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">\n    public class Person\n    {\n        public Guid PersonId { get; set; }\n        public string FirstName { get; set; }\n        public string LastName { get; set; }\n        private decimal Salary { get; set; }\n\n        private string Mydocpath = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.MyDocuments);\n\n        public string FullName()\n        {\n            return $\"{FirstName} - {LastName}\";\n        }\n\n        public decimal GetSalary()\n        {\n            return this.Salary;\n        }\n\n        public void IncreaseSalary(decimal percentage)\n        {\n            this.Salary += this.Salary * percentage;\n        }\n\n        public void SavePerson()\n        {\n            try\n            {\n                // code for saving person to a data store\n\n                //After a person has been saved, we send confirmation email\n                var mailMessage = new MailMessage(\"MailFrom\", \"MailTo\", \"Subject\", \"Body\");\n                this.SendEmail(mailMessage);\n\n            }\n            catch (Exception e)\n            {\n                System.IO.File.WriteAllText(this.Mydocpath + @\"\\Exceptionsfile.txt\", e.ToString());\n            }\n        }\n\n        public void SendEmail(MailMessage mail)\n        {\n            try\n            {\n                // Code for getting Email setting and send mail\n            }\n            catch (Exception e)\n            {\n                System.IO.File.WriteAllText(this.Mydocpath + @\"\\Exceptionsfile.txt\", e.ToString());\n            }\n        }\n\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <em>Person</em> class violates SRP, as it behaves like a God Object.

We will have to alter the <mark><em>Shape</em></mark> class and add one or more if condition to satisfy the requirement and equally alter the enum to add the new type of shape. Adding more if conditions to cater to new shapes will quickly run out of hands and make the code unmaintainable and difficult to test.

The <mark><em>Shape</em></mark> class is now closed for modification because to add a new feature of calculating a new shape, we don't alter or modify the Shape class.

Let’s get\nstarted\n\nThe SOLID principle is a design pattern that enables and disciplines us to write\nreusable, decoupled, and maintainable code. That is as simple as it can get.\n\nNow, we know what the SOLID principles want to get out of us, let’s briefly talk\nabout what makes a code SOLID. SOLID codes have to satisfy SOLID principle\nchecklist which leads us to the SOLID acronym and what it means.\n\n * S: Single Responsible Principle (SRP)\n * O: Open Closed Principle (OSP)\n * L: Liskov Substituion Principle\n * I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\n * D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\n\nLet’s go throw each with code walkthrough\n\nS: Single Responsible Principle (SRP)\n> A class should have only one reason to change\n\n\n\n\nSRP says that a class should focus on one specific thing rather than do multiple\nthings. The SRP simple does not mean a class should have only one method, but\neverything the class does should revolve around one thing.\nFor example, a Person class might have the responsibility of carrying out a\nvarious operation such as creating a new person’s record, update, delete, and\nretrieve from a data store. The class can also be tasked on how to present\ninformation to a user such as print, display, sending email, logging etc.\n\nMixing up responsibility makes a class unmaintainable, challenging to understand\nand makes writing unit tests a nightmare because the responsibilities cannot be\nseparated and thus ultimately violates SRP.\n\n\n\nLet’s see an example of SRP violation:\n\n\n    public class Person\n    {\n        public Guid PersonId { get; set; }\n        public string FirstName { get; set; }\n        public string LastName { get; set; }\n        private decimal Salary { get; set; }\n\n        private string Mydocpath = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.MyDocuments);\n\n        public string FullName()\n        {\n            return $\"{FirstName} - {LastName}\";\n        }\n\n        public decimal GetSalary()\n        {\n            return this.Salary;\n        }\n\n        public void IncreaseSalary(decimal percentage)\n        {\n            this.Salary += this.Salary * percentage;\n        }\n\n        public void SavePerson()\n        {\n            try\n            {\n                // code for saving person to a data store\n\n                //After a person has been saved, we send confirmation email\n                var mailMessage = new MailMessage(\"MailFrom\", \"MailTo\", \"Subject\", \"Body\");\n                this.SendEmail(mailMessage);\n\n            }\n            catch (Exception e)\n            {\n                System.IO.File.WriteAllText(this.Mydocpath + @\"\\Exceptionsfile.txt\", e.ToString());\n            }\n        }\n\n        public void SendEmail(MailMessage mail)\n        {\n            try\n            {\n                // Code for getting Email setting and send mail\n            }\n            catch (Exception e)\n            {\n                System.IO.File.WriteAllText(this.Mydocpath + @\"\\Exceptionsfile.txt\", e.ToString());\n            }\n        }\n\n    }\n\n\nThe Person class violates SRP, as it behaves like a God Object. A God Object is\na class which does everything. An example of a God Object is this:\n\n\n\nThe Swiss army knife in the pictures does so much than just being a pocket tool.\nIt can also store your files .\n\nBack to the Person class which carries out own responsibilities such as get full\nname, get a salary, increase salary and also sending emails and logging as well.\n\nThe \"A class should have only one reason to change\" will not be met if for\nexample, you want to modify the email, logging functionalities or perhaps\nwriting a unit test to test each feature.\n\nSolution:\nLet's refactor the code to satisfy SRP\n\n\n    public class Person\n    {\n        public Guid PersonId { get; set; }\n        public string FirstName { get; set; }\n        public string LastName { get; set; }\n        private decimal Salary { get; set; }\n\n        private FileLogger fileLogger;\n        private MailSender mailSender;\n\n\n        public Person()\n        {\n            fileLogger = new FileLogger();\n            mailSender = new MailSender();\n        }\n\n        public string FullName()\n        {\n            return $\"{FirstName} - {LastName}\";\n        }\n\n        public decimal GetSalary()\n        {\n            return this.Salary;\n        }\n\n        public void IncreaseSalary(decimal percentage)\n        {\n            this.Salary += this.Salary * percentage;\n        }\n\n        public void SavePerson()\n        {\n            try\n            {\n                // code for saving person to a data store\n\n                //After a person has been saved, we send confirmation email\n                //Abstracting away how email is being sent\n                fileLogger.Info(\"Add method Start\");\n                // Code for adding invoice\n                // Once Invoice has been added , send mail \n                mailSender.From = \"contact@gmail.com\";\n                mailSender.To = \"recipient@google.com\";\n                mailSender.Subject = \"Verification\";\n                mailSender.Body = \"This is an email message for Bob and Alice\";\n                mailSender.SendEmail();\n            }\n            catch (Exception e)\n            {\n                fileLogger.Error(\"Exception message\", e);\n            }\n        }\n\n    }\n\n\n\n\n    public interface ILogger\n    {\n        void Info(string info);\n        void Debug(string info);\n        void Error(string info, Exception e);\n    }\n\n    public class FileLogger : ILogger\n    {\n        private string MyDocpath = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.MyDocuments);\n\n        public FileLogger()\n        {\n            //Initialization code(s)\n        }\n\n        public void Info(string info)\n        {\n            // Code for details to text file \n        }\n\n        public void Debug(string info)\n        {\n            // Code for debug information to text file \n        }\n\n        public void Error(string message, Exception ex)\n        {\n            // Code for erros with message and exception details\n        }\n    }\n\n\n    public class MailSender\n    {\n        public string From { get; set; }\n        public string To { get; set; }\n        public string Subject { get; set; }\n        public string Body { get; set; }\n\n        public void SendEmail()\n        {\n            // Code for sending mail\n        }\n    }\n\n\nNow the Person class can focus on what it knows how to do best, and that is how\nto create, save, calculate salary about a user and cares less about sending\nemails or logging hence satisfies the Single Responsibility Princciple. The\nother tasks of logging and email sending are delegated to the responsible\nclasses separating the concerns and responsibilities.\n\n\n\nO: Open Closed Principle (OSP)\n> Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc) should be open for\nextension , but closed for modification.\n\n\n\n\nTo put it in a simple sentence, change a class behaviour using inheritance and\ncomposition.\n\n\"Open for extension\" means we ought to design our classes in a way that will\nallow new feature or functionality to be added when new requirements arise or a\nchange of request comes up. \"Closed for modification means\" we should not alter\ncodes that have already gone through design, coding, unit testing and it is\nin-production unless it is a bug.\n\nLet's demonstrate OSP using codes using a Shape class.\n\nOSP violation:\n\n\n    public enum ShapeType\n    {\n        Triangle, Rectangle, Circle\n    }\n\n    public class Shape\n    {\n        public ShapeType ShapeType { get; set; }\n        public double Width { get; set; }\n        public double Height { get; set; }\n\n        public string CalculateArea( )\n        {\n            var calculatedArea = default(double);\n\n            if (ShapeType == ShapeType.Triangle)\n            {\n                calculatedArea =  Height * Width;\n            }else if (ShapeType == ShapeType.Triangle)\n            {\n                calculatedArea = 0.5 * Width * Height;\n            }\n            else if(ShapeType == ShapeType.Circle)\n            {\n                calculatedArea = Math.PI * Math.Pow(Height, 2);\n            }\n\n            return calculatedArea.ToString(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);\n        }\n    }\n\n\nNow, this simple Shape class represents a shape and calculates its area. This\nscenario will work well without issues only if we have to calculate only three\nshapes, Triangle, Rectangle Circle. What if we need to calculate the area of a\nsphere tomorrow or a rhombus? We will have to alter the Shape class and add one\nor more if condition to satisfy the requirement and equally alter the enum to\nadd the new type of shape. Adding more if conditions to cater to new shapes will\nquickly run out of hands and make the code unmaintainable and difficult to test.\nHence, the class is not \"closed for modification\".\n\n\n\nLet's make the Shape class \"Open for extension, but closed for modification\"\nhence satisfying OSP.\n\nOSP solution:\n\n    public abstract class Shape\n    {\n        public abstract double CalculateArea();\n    }\n\n\n    public class Triangle : Shape\n    {\n        public double Base { get; set; }\n        public double Height { get; set; }\n\n        public override double CalculateArea()\n        {\n            return 0.5 * Base * Height;\n        }\n    }\n\n\n    public class Cirle : Shape\n    {\n        public double Radius { get; set; }\n        public override double CalculateArea()\n        {\n            return Math.PI * (Radius * Radius);\n        }\n    }\n\n\nNow that looks much better. The Shape class is now closed for modification\nbecause to add a new feature of calculating a new shape, we don't alter or\nmodify the Shape class. Instead, we extended it by using inheritance.\n\nExtending the Shape class further by adding the rhombus shape will look like\nthis:\n\n\n    public class Rhombus : Shape\n    {\n        public double Diagonal { get; set; }\n        public override double CalculateArea()\n        {\n            return (1/2) * Diagonal * Diagonal;\n        }\n    }\n\n\nViola! we have satisfied OSP.\n\n\n\n\n\nL: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)\n> Objects in a program should be replacable with instances of their subtypes\nwithout altering the correctness of the that program.\n\n\n\n\nIn a simple translation, a child class can replace a parent class in a code, and\nit should not break that code. e.g. If class Dog is a child(derived class) of\nclass Animal(base class), then instances of Dog can replace the instance of\nAnimal without issue. Liskov substitution principle goes a bit deeper, but for a\nsimple explanation is a good starting position.\n\nNote: LSP is about honoring contracts and not intending to change the behaviour\nof a base class.\n\nThe code below violates LSP in that derived class Square changed the behaviour\nof the base class.\n\nViolation of LSP:\n\n\n    public class Rectangle\n    {\n        public virtual Int32 Height { get; set; }\n        public virtual Int32 Width { get; set; }\n\n        public virtual void CalculateArea()\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine($\"The area is: {Height * Width}\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public class Square : Rectangle\n    {\n        public override Int32 Height\n        {\n            get => base.Height;\n            set => SetDimensions(value);\n        }\n\n        public override Int32 Width\n        {\n            get => base.Width;\n            set => SetDimensions(value);\n        }\n\n        private void SetDimensions(Int32 value)\n        {\n            base.Height = value;\n            base.Width = value;\n        }\n    }\n\n\nGiving the above code, a quick run, the output says The area is 9, which is\ncorrect as the area of a square is (width)2. But! this violates the LSP that\nstates that a derived class should replace a base class without breaking or\naltering the program.\n\n\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        Rectangle rectangle = new Square();\n        rectangle.Height = 2;\n        rectangle.Width = 3;\n\n        rectangle.CalculateArea(); // The area is 9\n        Console.ReadKey();\n    }\n\n\nLet implement the code to become LSP compliant. The solution to this problem is\nnot straightforward, but let have a look. Remember the OCP, if a code is OCP\ncomplaint, that code is more likely to be LSP compliant as well. As a rule of\nthumb, try to move implementation that may differ to the derived classes and\nleave the more general implementation to the base class.\n\n\n    public interface IShape\n    {\n        void CalculateArea();\n    }\n\n    public class Square : IShape\n    {\n        public double Width { get; set; }\n        public void CalculateArea()\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine($\"The area is {Math.Pow(Width, 2)}\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public class Rhombus : IShape\n    {\n        public double Diagonal { get; set; }\n        public void CalculateArea()\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine($\"The area is: {(1 / 2) * Diagonal * Diagonal}\");\n        }\n    }\n\n\nThe base class IShape contract is now implemented by Square and Rhombus with no\nviolation by not allowing the subclasses to change the behaviour of the base\nclass.\n\nImportant: If a code is OSP complaint, it is likely, it is LSP complaint as both\ngo hand in hand.\n\n\n\n\n\nI: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\n> No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not need. Split large\ninterfaces into smaller and more specific ones so clients can pick and choose\nmethods that are of interest to them.\n\n\n\n\nIn a simple sentence, this means a derived class should only implement what it\nneeds and not all methods in the parent class or interface.\n\nUsing the analogy of a manager, a lead developer, and a developer.\n\nViolation of ISP:\n\n\n    public interface ILead\n    {\n        void CreateSubTask();\n        void AssginTask();\n        void WorkOnTask();\n    }\n\n    public class Developer : ILead\n    {\n        public void CreateSubTask()\n        {\n            throw new Exception(\"Cannot create subtasks\");\n        }\n\n        public void AssginTask()\n        {\n            throw new Exception(\"Cannot assign tasks\");\n        }\n\n        public void WorkOnTask()\n        {\n            //codes to implement working on tasks\n        }\n    }\n\n    public class LeadDeveloper : ILead\n    {\n        public void CreateSubTask()\n        {\n            //code to create subtasks\n        }\n\n        public void AssginTask()\n        {\n            //code to assign tasks\n        }\n\n        public void WorkOnTask()\n        {\n            //codes to implement working on tasks\n        }\n    }\n\n    public class Manager : ILead\n    {\n        public void CreateSubTask()\n        {\n            //code to create subtasks\n        }\n\n        public void AssginTask()\n        {\n            //code to assign tasks\n        }\n\n        public void WorkOnTask()\n        {\n            throw new Exception(\"Manager cannot work on programming tasks\");\n        }\n    }\n\n\nWe have three roles in that a Manager cannot work on tasks and no can assign a\ntask to a manger aside from the manager's boss if there's another layer of\nhierarchy. But the Manager implements the WorkOnTask() method it doesn't need.\nSame for the Developer class, a developer cannot create subtasks and assign\ntasks hence should not be implementing both methods. As for the LeadDeveloper,\nit implements all method on the ILead interface as needed.\n\nSolution:\nThe solution is to split the interfaces into manageable chunks to clients can\npick and choose what they need to implement.\n\n\n    public interface ILead\n    {\n        void CreateSubTask();\n        void AssginTask();\n    }\n\n    public interface IProgrammer\n    {\n        void WorkOnTask();\n    }\n\n    public class Developer : IProgrammer\n    {\n        public void WorkOnTask()\n        {\n            //codes to implement working on tasks\n        }\n    }\n\n    public class LeadDeveloper : ILead, IProgrammer\n    {\n        public void CreateSubTask()\n        {\n            //code to create subtasks\n        }\n\n        public void AssginTask()\n        {\n            //code to assign tasks\n        }\n\n        public void WorkOnTask()\n        {\n            //codes to implement working on tasks\n        }\n    }\n\n    public class Manager : ILead\n    {\n        public void CreateSubTask()\n        {\n            //code to create subtasks\n        }\n\n        public void AssginTask()\n        {\n            //code to assign tasks\n        }\n    }\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\n> High level modules should not depend on low level modules, Both should depend on\nabstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend\non abstractions\n\n\n\n\nIn a simple sentence, high-level modules and low-level module should be loosely\ncoupled as much as possible. They need not know the detail implementation of\neach other, in other words, they should depend on a contract.\n\nLet's use the example of a notification system where we can either send Email,\nSMS or Mail depending on a user choosing. Alternatively, all three if the user\nopt-in for all.\n\nViolation of DIP:\n\n    public class Email\n    {\n        public string ToAddress { get; set; }\n        public string Subject { get; set; }\n        public string Content { get; set; }\n        public void SendEmail()\n        {\n            //Send email\n        }\n    }\n\n    public class SMS\n    {\n        public string PhoneNumber { get; set; }\n        public string Message { get; set; }\n        public void SendSMS()\n        {\n            //Send sms\n        }\n    }\n    \n    public class Mail\n    {\n        public string Address { get; set; }\n        public string Message { get; set; }\n        public void SendMail()\n        {\n            //Send Mail by post\n        }\n    }\n    \n    public class Notification\n    {\n        private Email _email;\n        private SMS _sms;\n        private Mail _mail;\n        public Notification()\n        {\n            _email = new Email();\n            _sms = new SMS();\n            _mail = new Mail();\n        }\n\n        public void Send()\n        {\n            _email.SendEmail();\n            _sms.SendSMS();\n            _mail.SendMail();\n        }\n    }\n\n\nAs we can see from the code sample above, the higher-level (Notification) module\nhas dependencies on Email, SMS, and Mail modules, which are lower-level modules\nwhich violate DIP, and the also violates Single Responsibility Principle.\n\nSolution:\n\n    public interface IMessage\n    {\n        void SendMessage();\n    }\n    \n    public class Email : IMessage\n    {\n        public string ToAddress { get; set; }\n        public string Subject { get; set; }\n        public string Content { get; set; }\n        public void SendMessage()\n        {\n            //Send Email\n        }\n    }\n\n    public class SMS : IMessage\n    {\n        public string PhoneNumber { get; set; }\n        public string Message { get; set; }\n        public void SendMessage()\n        {\n            //Send SMS\n        }\n    }\n    \n    public class Mail : IMessage\n    {\n        public string Address { get; set; }\n        public string Message { get; set; }\n        public void SendMessage()\n        {\n            //Send Mail by post\n        }\n    }\n\n\nThe Notification system can now do one thing and one thing only. Send message\nwithout bothering about the implementation details, but depend on abstraction.\n\n\n    public class Notification\n    {\n        private ICollection _messages;\n\n        public Notification(ICollection messages)\n        {\n            this._messages = messages;\n        }\n        public void SendMessage()\n        {\n            foreach(var message in _messages)\n            {\n                message.SendMessage();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n\nThis concludes SOLID principles.

[JavaScript OOP : Inheritance vs Composition]()\\n\\n\\nObject-oriented programming has four pillars which we will quickly go over. These pillars or concept define or set some guidelines on how to write codes to represent objects with characteristics and behaviours. E.g., A person may be described as an object with attributes like first name, last name, date of Birth and a person can eat, walk, run, and dance.\\n\\nThe four pillars are namely,  __Abstraction__, __Encapsulation__, __Inheritance__, and __Polymorphism__.  \\n\\n### Abstraction\\nAn abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP) is the process of hiding away the complexity of an object's internal implementation details and present relevant information without noise. An example of abstraction in the real world is a simple cassette player\\n\\n![Casset player](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1495369470453-f6af4ade471b?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&s=1b9c2148b9404faac82511c12524ffe7&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1350&q=80)\\n\\nThis cassette player has few buttons on it, but the implementation details of how the electronics embedded inside work are abstracted away, it's hidden, and all that's useful to a music listener is the play, pause, forward, rewind and record buttons. The details of how the capacitors, diode , resistors, circuit board work is of no importance and as a music listener, I don't know want know either.\\n\\n### Encapsulation\\nIn a simple sentence, encapsulation is the process of hiding internal details or implementation from the outside such that it helps prevent tampering and accidental modification. As you programming more and create objects, you will quickly realise some details should never leak as a result of our code which could lead to serious problems like data breach, losing sensitive data and confidentiality. Different programming languages use different implementation to achieve encapsulation. In the coming post, we will see how we can implement encapsulation in JavaScript which is a bit different from strongly typed languages like C# and Java.   \\n\\n### Inheritance\\nInheritance in OOP is just like inheritance in real life whereby a child inherits the parent(s) trait(s) such as eye colours, height etc.  Inheritance describes an \\\"IS-A\\\" relationship e.g. a dog is an Animal etc. Inheritance in OOP helps reduce code duplication by re-using codes or sharing codes. E.g. You are writing an application for a vet. You have to ensure that your application can handle check-in and check-out of all kinds of animal. The only way to make this possible is by re-using code. In this case, you will have a base object called Animal with general characteristics animal characteristics and have, e.g. dogs; cat inherits from the Animal class. In conclusion, inheritance is the ability of a child object to inherit a parent object properties and behaviours in addition to its own.\\n\\n### Polymorphism\\n*Poly* means many, and *morphism* means forms. Polymorphism is the ability of an object to exist or represented in many forms. In OOP, child or children object may inherit behaviour from a parent object and override or implement that object differently from the parent.  In conclusion, *polymorphism* is the ability of an object to change behaviour at runtime.  \\n\\n### Composition\\nComposition is an important OOP concept worth mentioning. It's not one of the four listed pillars of OOP, but OOP is not complete without it. Unlike inheritance, composition is a *\\\"HAS-A\\\"* relationship. A dog is an animal, but a dog has an owner. An object representing a dog will relate to the animal object by inheritance, but relate to owner through composition.\\n\\nThis concludes the information needed to delve into the concepts of OOP deeper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>This post is part of a series of posts on JavaScript object-oriented programming.

A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.*==  \\n\\nIn other words, an object is a collection of key=value pair.\\n\\ne.g      firstname = \\\"John\\\", lastname = \\\"Fischer\\\" .  These two key-value pair can make up an object\\n\\n<p class=\\\"space\\\"></p>\\n\\n#### Objects & properties\\n\\nTo represent a *Person* object in JavaScript, let's use *Object* with is JavaScript in-built.

In demonstrating object creation, we will focus on a\nrepresenting a person.\n\n\n\nObject constructor: new Object();\nWe've previously gone through creating an object using the Object constructor,\nbut it's worth mentioning again to help solidify the concept.\n\n\n    var person = new Object();\n    person.id = 123;\n    person.firstname = \"John\";\n    person.lastname = \"Fischer\"\n    person.age = 24;\n    person.showMove = function(){\n        console.log(\"I can do a split!\");\n    };\n\n\n\n\nObject Literals\nUsing the new Object() constructor can be quite convoluted and lengthy, but\nobject literals provide shortcut for creating objects, but under the hood, new\nObject() is still being used.\n\n\n    var person = {\n        id: 123,\n        firstname: \"John\",\n        lastname: \"Fischer\",\n        age: 24;\n        showMove : function(){\n            console.log(\"I can do a split!\");\n        };\n     }\n\n\n\n\nPatterns for creating Objects\nConstructor Functions\n\nConstructor functions try to emulate the concept of classes in strongly typed\nlanguages such as C# and Java. There are some convention to adhere to though.\nThe naming convention for constructor function starts with uppercase letter and\nthe rest lowe-case letters.\n\nNote: Functions are also objects. A function's prototype points to/inherits from\nObject which is the root object in JavaScript\n\n\n    function Person(firstname, lastname, age) {\n      this.firstname = firstname;\n      this.lastname = lastname;\n      this.age = age;\n      this.showMove = function(){\n        console.log(\"I can do a split!\");\n      }\n\n    }\n\n\nWith this pattern, all kind of Person object can be created say, Bob and Alice.\n\n\n    let alice = new Person(\"Alice\", \"Guru\", 27);\n    let bob = new Person(\"Bob\", \"Don\", 32);\n\n\nWe now have Alice and Bob objects, and more can be created, but always pay\nattention that the constructor function is always instantiated or activated with\nthe new keyword.\n\n\n\nFactory function\nFactory function is a pattern for creating objects, and it's reusable. We see\nhow this function can be used to enforce privacy in later series. For now, let's\nsee how to create object using the factory pattern.\n\n\n    function createPerson(firstname, lastname, age) {\n      return {\n        firstname,\n        lastname,\n        age,\n        showMove: function(){\n            console.log(\"I can do a split!\");\n        }\n      }\n\n    }\n    \n    let alice = createPerson(\"Alice\", \"Guru\", 27);\n    let bob = createPerson(\"Bob\", \"Don\", 32);\n\n\n\n\nPrototype pattern\nObjects can also be created in JavaScript using prototype property of an object. \nRemember that every created object in JavaScript automatically has a prototype\nat the time of creation. Let's see how we can use prototype to create an object.\n\n\n    function Person() {\n    }\n    \n    Person.prototype.firstname = \"Bob\";\n    Person.prototype.lastname = \"Guru\";\n    Person.prototype.age = 24;\n    Person.prototype.showMove = function(){\n      console.log(\"I can do a split!\");\n    }\n    \n\n\nWe shall examine prototype property further as it holds the key to OOP in\nJavaScript.\n\nThis concludes the objection creation series. We'll use all we've learned so far\nin the next coming series to really make sense of OOP in JavaScript.\n\nHappy coding.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1527612820672-5b56351f7346?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2018-04-29 06:45:08","updated_at":"2019-07-07 18:53:07","published_at":"2018-05-02 15:55:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5f37e7a7d486c307401b3ee5","uuid":"60499792-79c8-42c1-bfed-5b1474ab165a","title":"JavaScript OOP : Encapsulation","slug":"pillars-of-object-oriented-programming-encapsulation","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"This post is part of a series of posts on JavaScript object-oriented programming.

Suppose we are tasked to implement a solution to store and keep tracks of different shapes, how would we go about designing our system conforming to OOP?  \\n\\nOur focus is on **inheritance** right now. Let's design out shape application. A shape object with a basic property or method that knows how to draw shapes.  \\n\\n<pre><code>\\n    function Shape(){\\n    }\\n\\n    Shape.prototype.draw = function(){\\n      console.log(\\\"This shape is drawn\\\");\\n    };\\n</code></pre>\\n\\nNow we have a base object (Shape) which will serve as a prototype (or parent) to other types of shapes we will implement.  Let's create a circle shape that inherits from our base Shape object.\\n\\n<pre><code>\\n    function Circle(radius){\\n      this.radius = radius;\\n    }\\n\\n    //Circle inherits from Shape object\\n    Circle.prototype = Object.create(Shape.prototype);\\n\\n    //Setting the constructor to Circle object\\n    //to allow for creation of new Circle Object\\n    Circle.prototype.constructor = Circle;\\n</code></pre>\\n\\nThe parent object (Shape) has a property draw  which is inherited by the the child object (Circle).\\n\\n![childfunc](/content/images/2018/07/childfunc.png?w=600&q=80&style=center)  \\n\\nNow let's give each shape object color and names without repeating codes.

However, we will stick to few shapes.\\n\\n\\n<pre><code>\\n    function Shape(color, name){\\n        this.color = color;\\n        this.name = name;\\n    }\\n\\n    Shape.prototype.draw = function(){\\n      console.log(`${this.name} with color ${this.color} is drawn!`);\\n    };\\n\\n\\n    //Circle Shape\\n    function Circle(radius, name, color){\\n        Shape.call(this, color, name); //Calling the base or parent class\\n        this.radius = radius;\\n      }\\n\\n      //Circle inherit from Shape\\n      inherit(Shape, Circle);\\n\\n\\n    //Triangle Shape\\n    function Triangle(base, height, name, color){\\n        Shape.call(this, color, name);\\n        this.base = base;\\n        this.height = height;\\n      }\\n\\n      //Triangle inherit from Shape\\n      inherit(Shape, Triangle);\\n\\n\\n      //Rectangle Shape\\n    function Rectangle(length, breath, name, color){\\n        Shape.call(this, color, name);\\n        this.length = length;\\n        this.breath = breath;\\n      }\\n\\n      //Rectangle inherit from Shape\\n      inherit(Shape, Rectangle);\\n\\n\\n    function inherit(Parent, Child){\\n        Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype);\\n        Child.prototype.constructor = Child;\\n    }\\n</code></pre>  \\n\\nNow we have different shapes implementing or inheriting from the Shape object.

As a reminder, abstraction is the process of hiding away implementation and internal details and present the user with what's needed. We are going to focus on the cassette player we used in the previous post on abstraction. Remember this?\\n\\n![Casset player](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1495369470453-f6af4ade471b?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&s=1b9c2148b9404faac82511c12524ffe7&auto=format&fit=crop&w=600&q=80&style=center)\\n\\nLet's now represent our cassette player as an object by abstracting away the internal implementation:\\n\\n<pre><code>\\n    function CassettePlayer(cassette){\\n      this.cassette = cassette;\\n\\n      this.play = function(){\\n        console.log(`I am playing ${this.cassette}`);\\n      };\\n      \\n      this.pause = function(){\\n        //pause cassette\\n      }\\n\\n      this.stop = function(){\\n        //stop playing\\n      };\\n\\n      this.record = function(){\\n        //record onto a cassette\\n      };\\n\\n      this.forward = function(){\\n        //forward cassette\\n      };\\n\\n      this.rewind = function(){\\n        //rewind cassette\\n      };\\n\\n      this.eject = function(){\\n        //eject cassette\\n      };\\n    }\\n</code></pre>\\n\\nNow as we have abstracted the CassetPlayer object and do not care about its implementation details. All a user cares about is to play, pause, stop, rewind, forward, record, and eject using the CassettePlayer. \\n\\nThis is abstraction.

Without further\ndue, let's master this methods with examples.\n\n> The call(), apply(), and bind() method all do the same thing with some slight\nvariation.\nMethod borrowing in JavaScript is the concept of reusing an exiting method\nwithin the context of different object or reuse method outside the context with\nwhich it was created.\n\n> Say object A has a method f, object B should be able to use method f of A if the\nsame property(ies) are present in both object.\nLet's illustrate this concept in code. \n\nLet's say objects A and B\n\n    //object A\n    let A = {\n        name: \"Michael\",\n        lastName: \"Programmer\",\n        getFullName(){\n            console.log(`The full name is ${this.name} ${this.lastName}`)\n        }\n    }\n\n    //object B\n    let B = {\n        name: \"Another\",\n        lastName: \"Michael\"\n    }\n\nBorrowing\nNow let's borrow the getFullName method of object A to output to the console\ndetails of object B\n\nCall() method\n> call(thisArg: any, arg1, arg2...argn)\nThe call method accepts an argument list separated by commas. The first argument\nreferences the this keyword, which is the object you are trying to switch\ncontext to. In the example below, object B is this\n\nA.getFullName.call(B); // The full name is Another Michael\n\nBoom! that simple.\n\nWe could also rip out the method from the object A and have object A and object\nB borrow and use the function.\n\n    let namePrinter = function(){\n        console.log(`The full name is ${this.name} ${this.lastName}`);\n    };\n\n\t//object A\n    let A = {\n        name: \"Michael\",\n        lastName: \"Programmer\"\n    }\n    \n    //object B\n    let B = {\n        name: \"Another\",\n        lastName: \"Michael\"\n    };\n    \n    namePrinter.call(A); //The full name is Michael Programmer\n    namePrinter.call(B); //The full name is Another Michael\n\n\n\nPassing argument\n\nIn case you are wondering, we can also pass arguments let see this with an\nexample. Suppose the namePrinter function also accepts and output a country. You\ncan pass in the argument after referencing this. Let's create another function\naccepting an argument and let's borrow it. Let's also add objects C and D.\n\n    let namePrinterWithHomeTown = function (hometown) {\n      console.log(`${this.name} ${this.lastName} is from ${hometown}`);\n    }\n    \n    //object C\n    let C = {\n      name: \"Jack\",\n      lastName: \"Black\"\n    };\n\n    //object D\n    let D = {\n      name: \"Alaka\",\n      lastName: \"Kamba\"\n    };\n\n    namePrinterWithHomeTown.call(A, \"Serbia\") // Michael Programmer is from Serbia\n\n\n\nApply() method\n> apply(thisArg: [args])\nThe apply method works the exact same way as the call method but it accepts an\narray of argument after referencing this.\n\n    namePrinter.apply(C) //The first name is Jack, last name is Black\n\nPassing arguments\n\n    namePrinterWithHomeTown.apply(C, [\"Madagascar\"]) //Jack Black is from Madagascar\n\nBind() method\n> bind(thisArg, Args)\nBind behaves very similar to apply and call method with the only difference\nbeing bind is deferred which means it has to be manually invoked because it's\nnot invoked automatically like call and apply. Let see this in code.\n\n    let objD = namePrinter.bind(D); \n    objD(); // The first name is Alaka, last name is Kamba\n\nPassing argument\n\n    let nameCountry = namePrinterWithHomeTown.bind(C, \"Peru\");\n    nameCountry(); // Jack Black is from Peru\n\nA great benefit of these methods is reusability. If you have multiple object\nhaving same or very similar shape, and you want to carry out a common operation\nacross these objects, you can function borrow if you are not using prototypical\ninheritance.\n\nThroughout the javascript ecosystem, the call, bind, & apply method can be used\nwith almost anything in terms or attaching and switching contexts. Below is a\nplayground to play around with these methods. Open up the console at the bottom\nright to see results. \n\nI will explore some advance application of these methods in another post which\nwill go in-depth to explain some powerful concepts.\n\nHappy

One of my favourites is\nstill C# .NET Core as I do C# almost on a daily basis, but a side of me wanted\nto be platform and framework agnostics as much as I can. I have been taking\nadvantage of tradeoffs in the different languages/framework in developing\nmicro-services. Some argue that you've got to master one language really well\nand then one framework really well. I say, You can master them all, be\nproficient and be able to develop production ready applications. In my case, I\ncurrently do .Net Core (MVC/Web API), Spring Boot (Java, Kotlin (preferred)),\nPython (Django, Flask(preferred)), JavaScript/TypeScript is also worth\nmentioning, but that's another topic for another day. In a future post, I shall\ndetail a small project using all these technology and framework in a\n architecture of micro-services . As I sink my feet more into the world of\nmicro-services, and the plethora of technologies that can come together and\nfunction as a big ol system, it is a fascinating and yet intriguing experience.\nHaving had a strong Java programming experience under my belt, I was able to get\nstarted quickly with Kotlin and the transition is almost none existent. I'd say\nflawless. I have been using Kotlin in production at work and it's a pure joy to\nwork with in comparison to Java. An analogy to explain Kotlin vs Java would be\ntaking the elevator or using the stairs to get to the 100th floor of a building,\nand Kotlin is the elevator. One catch is that Kotlin compiles to Java in the\nbackground. More also, Kotlin and Java can interop really well. You can extend\nyour existing Java codes with Kotlin or mix-match them.\n\n\nWith the knowledge of Java, I do catch myself inspecting the compiled Java code\nto see the nitty-gritty of what's happening under the hood when I come across\nsome not so understandable Kotlin syntax. No matter how Kotlin syntax looks on\nIntelliJ Idea, my god, it's still beautiful wow!\n\n\nLet's say we want to create an InvoiceModel class that represents an invoice for\na nursery.

Source code for this post can be found here\n[https://github.com/mcvavy/DomainEvent]\n\nThis post focuses on the abstract of Domain Event in Domain Driven Design (DDD)\nwhich is also a fundamental building block of microservices or eventing system.\n\n\n\n> An event is something that has happened in the past. A domain event is,\nsomething that happened in the domain that you want other parts of the same\ndomain (in-process) to be aware of. The notified parts usually react somehow to\nthe events.\n\n\nDependency Injection does not eliminate tight coupling\nWhile this post is not specific to microservices, the domain event pattern can\nbe implemented in any system to reduce tight coupling  between your services. An\nexample would be an MVC controller with a lot of dependencies, services or\nrepositories injected via constructor injection.\n\nAdapting Udi Dahan's Domain Events Salvation\n[http://udidahan.com/2009/06/14/domain-events-salvation/] post to .Net Core\nimplementation.\n\nRaising Events with side effects within a system\nWithout injecting any dependencies at compile time, any part of a system can\nhave task completed without having prior knowledge of handler that would handle\nthe commands. Some of the example we would look at includes, completing an order\nby raising an event and having the proper handler located which will handle the\nevent such as writing the order to a data store or sending an email to the\ncustomer.\n\nIn the interest of time we'll talk about a domain object and we'll see how that\ninteracts with the system and you may refer to the source code further to see\nother examples or feel free to leave any questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Domain Object\n    public class Order\n    {\n        public Guid OrderId { get; private set; }\n        public DateTime OrderDate { get; private set; }\n        public int NumberOfItems { get; set; }\n        public string OrderName { get; private set; }\n        \n        public Order(int numberOfItems, string orderName)\n        {\n            OrderId = Guid.NewGuid();\n            OrderDate = DateTime.UtcNow;\n            NumberOfItems = numberOfItems;\n            OrderName = orderName;\n        }\n\n        public void OrderComplete()\n        {\n            DomainEvent.Raise(new OrderCompletedEvent(DateTime.UtcNow, this));\n        }\n    }\n\nThe order domain object has a behavior such that when an order is created, it\nbroadcasts an OrderCompletedEvent event of itself to the DomainEvent or\nDispatcher and any handler that knows how to handle the event will respond and\nhandles it. These handlers can also be referred to as Event Listeners or\nSubscribers.\n\nThe event is raised via the DomainEvent which is a static class. DomainEvent\nstatic class knows about all of the event handler and able to locate and invoke\nthe right event handler for a given event. More about the DomainEvent shortly.\n\n\n\nThe OrderCompletedEvent\n    public class OrderCompletedEvent : IDomainEvent\n    {\n        public DateTime OrderCreatedDate { get; private set; }\n        public Order Order { get; private set; }\n        \n        \n        public OrderCompletedEvent(DateTime orderCreatedDate, Order order)\n        {\n            OrderCreatedDate = orderCreatedDate;\n            Order = order;\n        }\n    }\n\nThe OrderCompletedEvent class implements an interface without any contract to\nimplement merely decorating the class as a type called IDomainEvent.\n\npublic interface IDomainEvent{}\n\nThe OrderCompletedEvent has an instance of the Order object and it's duty is to\ntransport the Order object along with any needed property or behavior to the\nhandler.\n\n\n\nThe DomainEvent\nThe DomainEvent is responsible for some behaviors and they include\n\n> Registering handler manually via its Register method\n> Forwarding an event to the proper handler by iterating over all handlers for a\nparticular type resolved from the IoC container\nAn IoC container is not required but imagine if you have to manually register\ntens of handlers in your system.\n\n    public static class DomainEvent\n    {\n        [ThreadStatic]\n        private static List<Delegate> _actions;\n\n        public static IServiceProvider _serviceProvider { get; set; }\n\n        \n        public static void Register<T>(Action<T> callback) where T : IDomainEvent\n        {\n            _actions = _actions ?? new List<Delegate>();\n            _actions.Add(callback);\n        }\n\n        public static void ClearCallbacks()\n        {\n            _actions = null;\n        }\n\n        public static void Raise<T>(T args) where T : IDomainEvent\n        {\n            if (_serviceProvider != null)\n            {\n                //Fetch all handler of this type from the IoC container and invoke their handle method.\n                foreach (var handler in (IEnumerable<IDomainHandler<T>>)_serviceProvider\n                    .GetService(typeof(IEnumerable<IDomainHandler<T>>)))\n                {\n                    handler.Hanle(args);\n                }\n            }\n            \n            if (_actions != null)\n            {\n                foreach (var action in _actions)\n                {\n                    if (action is Action<T>)\n                    {\n                        ((Action<T>) action)(args);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nThe generic Raise<T> method in the DomainEvent static class iterates through all\nthe handler using the resolved types from the IoC container.  The DomainEvent\nhas to be bootstrapped on application startup taking in an instance of the IoC\ncontainer or resolver. In the case of this application, takes an instance of\nServiceProvider built from type registration on the instance of\nServiceCollection. Don't pay attention to the ServiceProvider and\nServiceCollection as they specific to .Net Core and you can choose to use any\nIoC container of your choice.\n\n\n\nThe Event Handlers\nThe EventHandlers go into a separate project that mimics the Onion architecture.\nAccording to the onion architecture, the handlers fits into the Infrastructure\nlayer as they most likely will interact with other services and data stores or\ncarry out some infrastructure related tasks. You get the gist.\n\n> OrderCompleteHandler.cs\n    public class OrderCompleteHandler : IDomainHandler<OrderCompletedEvent>\n    {\n        public void Hanle(OrderCompletedEvent @event)\n        {\n            @event.Order.NumberOfItems = 100;\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Order Information: \\n=======================\" +\n                              $\"\\nOrder completed on {@event.OrderCreatedDate.ToShortDateString()} \" +\n                              $\"at {@event.OrderCreatedDate:HH:mm:ss tt}\\nID: {@event.Order.OrderId}\" +\n                              $\"\\nNumber of order items: {@event.Order.NumberOfItems}\" +\n                              $\"\\n____________________________________\");\n        }\n    }\n\nThe event handler in this case, OrderCompleteHandler knows to listens for and\nknows how to handle OrderCompletedEvent we talked about earlier above.

This\nwill quickly become a repetitive task and I wanted to automate this process and\nsafe me time from manually purging the CDN and at the same time, spend little to\nnothing on costs in doing so. I currently host my blog on Azure blob storage as\na static site. Azure has amazing services to do just that.\n\nThe proposed solution\nAzure offer amazing services to help resolve this issue. The proposed solution\nis summarised as follows; Azure storage blob emits an event whenever new\ncontents are uploaded. Azure Event Grid listens to the event and notifies\ninterested subscriber(s) about the event raised by the blob storage. Event Grid\ntriggers a webhook attached to an automation Powershell runbook which purges the\nCDN cached contents thereby allowing for the new contents to become available\nimmediately after new content is uploaded to the blob storage.\n\nThe Details\n\n\nIn short, Azure Event Grid enables you to build event-driven architecture and\ncapable of integrating with a lot of Azure Services. This post will focus on\nimplementing the proposed solution without going into details on what Event Grid\nis. Feel free to read more on Azure Event Grid here\n[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/overview].\n\nThis post assumes you already have an Azure CDN profile in place  as we won't be\ncreating one in this post. Refer to this link if you need to create an Azure\nCDN; Quickstart: Create an Azure CDN profile and endpoin\n[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-create-new-endpoint]t.\n\nAz Module set up\nThe Azure run book is the hander of the event and will subsequently run the\nPowershell code to trigger and purge the CDN profile of its cached content.\nLet's begin by creating an Azure automation account.\n\n\nFrom the Azure portal navigate to Automation Accounts and create an account.\n\n\n\nNext navigate to the newly created automation account and nagivate to Modules \nblade under the Shared Resources section.  We will be installing the Powershell\nAzure Az modules needed to run the Powershell scripts.\n\nAzure currently provides two Powershell modules to interact with Azure resources\nand they are AzureRM and Az Modules. Azure recommends the use of Az module going\nforward as AzureRM will not be officially maintained from December 2020. More\ndetails here.\n\nClick on Browse Gallery and install the following modules:\n\nAz.Account - For authenticating and authorising with Azure\n\nAz.Resources - For interacting with Azure resources\n\nAz.Cdn - For manipulating Azure CDN resources\n\nAz.Automation - For interraction with Azure automation\n\n\n\nThe search bar type Az. and hit the enter key on your computer and you should\nsee results similar to the image below.  Find all the module listed above and\nimport them. See an example below.\n\n \n\nImport example\n\nThe Automation Runbook\nNow we have the Az modules setup and ready to go. Let's now create the\nPowershell runbook that will contain the scripts need to get the connection to\nour Azure automation account, authenticate and authorise with Azure, get details\nof our CDN and purge its content.\n\nNavigate back to the Automation account and click Runbooks under the Process\nAutomation blade or section and click on Create a runbook. Fill in the name of\nyour runbook, choose Powershell as the Runbook type and give it a description of\nyour choosing.\n\n\n\nCopy and paste the below Powershell script into the newly created Powershell\nrunbook.\n\n    \"Grabbing the connection...\"\n    $connectionName = \"AzureRunAsConnection\"\n\n    $cdnProfileName = \"your cdn profile\"\n    $RGName = \"your Resource Group\"\n    $CdnEndpointName = \"Your Cdn Endpoint Name\"\n    $AutomationAccountName = \"Your Automation Account Name\"\n\n\n    try{\n        $servicePrincipalConnection =  Get-AutomationConnection -Name $connectionName\n\n        \"Logging in to Azure....\"\n        Connect-AzAccount `\n            -ServicePrincipal `\n            -TenantId $servicePrincipalConnection.TenantId `\n            -ApplicationId $servicePrincipalConnection.ApplicationId `\n            -CertificateThumbprint $servicePrincipalConnection.CertificateThumbprint\n    }\n    catch{\n        if(!$servicePrincipalConnection){\n            $ErrorMessage = \"Connection $connectionName not found.\"\n            throw $ErrorMessage\n        }else{\n            Write-Error -Message $_.Exception\n            throw $_.Exception\n        }\n    }\n\n    \"Fetching the CDN custom domain name....\"\n    $customDomain = (Get-AzCdnCustomDomain -ResourceGroupName $RGName -ProfileName $cdnProfileName -EndpointName ghost)[0].HostName\n\n    \"Purging everything in the CDN with domain name: $customDomain ....\"\n    Unpublish-AzCdnEndpointContent `\n        -ProfileName $cdnProfileName `\n        -ResourceGroupName $RGName `\n        -EndpointName $CdnEndpointName `\n        -PurgeContent \"/*\"\n\n\n\nTesting & Publishing the Runbook\nIt's time to test and publish the runbook. Still, on the runbook, you created\nthe last time, click on the Test pane and click the Start button to manually\ntrigger the runbook.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf everything is properly implemented, the Powershell runbook should start\nrunning and have the status displayed in the job stream log and when the test is\ncompleted successfully, a completed status along with the stream is displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigating to Azure CDN profile and inspecting the activity log, you should now\nsee a Purge operation with a Succeeded status, how long the operation took and\nthe service principal that initiated the action which is the\nAzureRunAsConnection we agreed for Azure to create when we created the\nautomation account. Behind the scene, Azure created this service principal of\ntype AzureServicePrincipal with Azure Active Directory (AAD) to save us the\nplumbing details. For more details visit the connections blade under the shared\nresources section of your automation account to see details this service\nprincipal.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we have a working Powershell runbook ready to be triggered. Let wire up a\nwebhook that will trigger the runbook.\n\n\n\nThe Webhook\nAzure automation runbook can expose an HTTP endpoint or webhook whichever makes\nsense. In the context of Azure automation runbook, it's called webhook. The\nwebhook, in this case, is analogous to a different or channel with which\nmessages and triggers get to the runbook.\n\nTo create the webhook, navigate to the runbook you have created and tested and\nclick on Add webhook, select Create new webhook, enter your preferred name for\nthe webhook, select enabled, set the expiry date, ensure you keep the webhook\nURL for later use and click OK and Create to create your webhook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Event Grid\nBefore I go any further I would like to clarify that Event Grid System Topics\nare system topics in Event Grid that represents events published by Azure\nservices such as Event Hubs, Azure storage account.
